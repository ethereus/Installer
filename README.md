web version of Installer, opens as a web page in your browser instead of as an app

Need the following python libraries:

- eel
- tqdm
- urllib

also need Chrome installed.. but you can just edit the text saying "Chrome" inside of the .py file to be another browser such as "Edge" if you really want to.

macos and Windows binaries are available under "releases",
although no future updates will be released in that form.
